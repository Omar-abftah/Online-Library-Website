                We oftentimes look towards the outside world to find the roots of our problems. However, most of
                the times we should be looking inwards. Our mind and our emotions determine our state of being in
                the present moment. If those aspects are left unchecked we can get easily overwhelmed and are left
                feeling unfulfilled every single day.
