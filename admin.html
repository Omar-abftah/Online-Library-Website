                <p>
                    Long ago, in a time forgotten, a preternatural event threw the seasons out of balance. In a land
                    where summers can last decades and winters a lifetime, trouble is brewing. The cold is returning,
                    and in the frozen wastes to the north of Winterfell, sinister forces are massing beyond the kingdom’s
                    protective Wall. To the south, the king’s powers are failing—his most trusted adviser dead under
                    mysterious circumstances and his enemies emerging from the shadows of the throne. At the center
                    of the conflict lie the Starks of Winterfell, a family as harsh and unyielding as the frozen land they
                    were born to. Now Lord Eddard Stark is reluctantly summoned to serve as the king’s new Hand, an
                    appointment that threatens to sunder not only his family but the kingdom itself.

                    We oftentimes look towards the outside world to find the roots of our problems. However, most of
                    the times we should be looking inwards. Our mind and our emotions determine our state of being in
                    the present moment. If those aspects are left unchecked we can get easily overwhelmed and are left
                    feeling unfulfilled every single day.

                <p>
                    Sixteen-year-old Maya is just an ordinary teen in an ordinary town. Sure, she doesn't know much
                    about her background - the only thing she really has to cling to is an odd paw-print birthmark on her
                    hip - but she never really put much thought into who her parents were or how she ended up with her
                    adopted parents in this tiny medical-research community on Vancouver Island.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Until now.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Strange things have been happening in this claustrophobic town - from the mountain lions that have
                    been approaching Maya to her best friend's hidden talent for "feeling" out people and situations, to
                    the sexy new bad boy who makes Maya feel...different. Combine that with a few unexplained deaths
                    and a mystery involving Maya's biological parents and it's easy to suspect that this town might have
                    more than its share of skeletons in its closet.

                    Jeremiah Thurston built Thurston House, San Francisco's grandest mansion. When he found himself
                    alone with his infant daughter, Sabrina, he was determined to bring her up to run the biggest mining
                    business in California. Nothing would stop her from taking over his dynasty -- not the San Francisco
                    earthquake, the deadly schemes of a cunning rival, the Great depression, or her own needs and
                    determination as she carries on the traditions established by her father.

                    Kelley Armstrong returns with the eagerly awaited follow-up to Dime Store Magic. Paige
                    Winterbourne, a headstrong young woman haunted by a dark legacy, is now put to the ultimate test
                    as she fights to save innocents from the most insidious evil of all..

                <p>
                    In the aftermath of her mother’s murder, Paige broke with the elite, ultraconservative American
                    Coven of Witches. Now her goal is to start a new Coven for a new generation. But while Paige
                    pitches her vision to uptight thirty-something witches in business suits, a more urgent matter
                    commands her attention.
