        <p>
            Jeremiah Thurston built Thurston House, San Francisco's grandest mansion. When he found himself
            alone with his infant daughter, Sabrina, he was determined to bring her up to run the biggest mining
            business in California. Nothing would stop her from taking over his dynasty -- not the San Francisco
            earthquake, the deadly schemes of a cunning rival, the Great depression, or her own needs and
            determination as she carries on the traditions established by her father.
