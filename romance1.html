            Sixteen-year-old Maya is just an ordinary teen in an ordinary town. Sure, she doesn't know much
            about her background - the only thing she really has to cling to is an odd paw-print birthmark on her
            hip - but she never really put much thought into who her parents were or how she ended up with her
            adopted parents in this tiny medical-research community on Vancouver Island.

            Until now.

            Strange things have been happening in this claustrophobic town - from the mountain lions that have
            been approaching Maya to her best friend's hidden talent for "feeling" out people and situations, to
            the sexy new bad boy who makes Maya feel...different. Combine that with a few unexplained deaths
            and a mystery involving Maya's biological parents and it's easy to suspect that this town might have
            more than its share of skeletons in its closet.
